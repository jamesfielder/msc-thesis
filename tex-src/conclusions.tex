In this project, we have primarily strived to understand the underlying physics which affects the flight
of a golf ball. In doing so we have been lead to consider the drag and lift functions in depth, as
these functions contain much of the subtlety that makes golf into such a popular game for people all
over the world.

The model we have developed, and the forms of $c_D$ and $c_L$, show much promise for improvement
in the future.
