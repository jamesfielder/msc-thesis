The R\&A kindly provided 5 full trajectories for use in this project. In this appendix we will
give some details as to these 5 data sets so as to aide future investigations into this topic.

The 5 data sets can be divided into 2 categories. The first data set is using one ball, and the latter
4 are using a different ball. We were not provided with values for the wind and as such have simply
assumed that the effects on the ball have been negligable during the flight.

Here we give the initial position, speed, spin, max height and carry for each of the data sets.
