\section{A small history of golf}

The origins of the game of golf are difficult to trace, with suggestions that the game originated
in either Scotland, France, the Netherlands, China, or even going back as far as the Romans.
Golf in its more modern incarnation however, is agreed to have originated in 15 th century
Scotland, where the first written records of the game are (somewhat humorously) related to
King James II of Scotland banning the game in 1457 for fear of a decrease in archery practice
in its favor.

From the 18 th century onwards golf began to take form fully in Scotland, with the founding
of both The Royal and Ancient Golf Club in St Andrews and The Royal Burgess Golfing Society
in Edinburgh. The oldest surviving rules of golf also date from this time, and these have been
in a state of constant revision until the modern day.

In the 19 th century the popularity of golf vastly increased, seeing larger numbers of people
knowing and playing the game, and the start of the first major tournaments. Additionally, the
game spread out along to much of the British empire, to the United States and eventually to
Japan, making golf into a global sport with a large industry to match.

In the modern day, golf is potentially one of the largest sports on earth, with golf tournaments,
golf manufacturing and related industries accounting for hundreds of billions of pounds of
economic activity. With such large stakes riding on the game, having a consistent and fair rule
set is of paramount importance and this is dealt with jointly by The R\&A (The Royal and
Ancient) in most of the world and the USGA (United States Golf Association) in the Americas.

\section{A slightly larger history of the golf ball}

Golf ball technology has advanced greatly since the advent of the game. Initially, hard wooden
balls were used for playing, however these were soon replaced with “featherie” balls which are
leather pouches stuffed with feathers and then painted white.

The next major innovation in the design of golf balls came in 1848, when the gutta-percha
ball was invented. This is the first ball to use a rubbery substance as continues to this day,
and was easier to make into a proper sphere, unlike the previous types of ball. It was around
this time that it was discovered that abrasions to the surface of the ball would improve the
aerodynamic properties of the ball, making it easier to control the flight of the ball and increasing
the distance at which the game could be played. This would start a series of innovations that
would lead to today’s dimpled balls, which we will discuss later.

After this, the golf ball once again changed form with the advent of using wrapped rubber
thread to help the ball to bounce better. This was coupled with the first time that a plastic
cover was added to the ball, in order to protect the rubber inside the ball on impact with the
club. This cover also persists to this day, although the inside of the ball has seen significant
development.

The modern golf ball has changed significantly from old designs. The interior of the ball is
now usually a 3 piece rubber composite, with different properties in each rubber to maximize
the controllability of the ball during play. The exterior is a polyurethane cover (usually white)
with usually between 300 to 400 dimples (though these can go as low as 200 dimples, and
beyond 600 in some cases). The properties of the ball are stipulated to be within certain ranges,
as set by The R\&A and USGA in the rules of golf. The weight of a ball must not be greater
than 45.93g, the diameter no less than 42.67mm and the ball must be spherically symmetric.
