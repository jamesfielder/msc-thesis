In order to devise a simple model for golf ball flight we first must understand some
prerequisite physics for projectiles and fluid dynamics for the airflow over the ball. Understanding
how the fluid flows over the surface of the ball is crucial to understanding the difference between
the flight of a golf ball and that of a standard projectile. Quantifying this effect will be a large
component of this project.

There is a large
