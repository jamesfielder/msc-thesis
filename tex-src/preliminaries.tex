In order to devise a simple model for golf ball flight we first must understand some
prerequisite physics for projectiles and fluid dynamics for the airflow over the ball. Understanding
how the fluid flows over the surface of the ball is crucial to understanding the difference between
the flight of a golf ball and that of a standard projectile. Quantifying this effect will be a large
component of this project.

There has been significant work done previously in understanding the fluid dynamics around a golf ball
and how a golf ball flies. We will attempt to review some of this literature in this chapter and summarise
previous work on the topic.

First though, we must understand how normal projectiles fly without taking into account fluid dynamics effects.
\section{Projectile Motion}
A projectile is a body fired into the air by an initial impulse and then allowed to fall back to ground under the
action of gravity alone. This is the most naive and simplistic model of golf ball flight, completely
ignoring all aerodynamic effects, however we must understand it before building up to a more
complex model.

Consider motion in a 2 dimensional plane, labelled by $x$ along the horizontal and $y$ along the vertical.
A projectile is given an initial speed of the form $\vv_0 = (v_x, v_y)$ at an angle $\alpha$ to
the horizontal. We set the origin of the coordinate system to be the point at the start of the
trajectory, $(x_0, y_0) = (0,0)$. In this problem the acceleration on the projectile, after the initial
impulse, is constant and of the form
\begin{equation} \label{grav}
a_x = 0, \quad a_y = -g
\end{equation}
where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. Since the acceleration is constant we can use
the standard formulas for motion under constant acceleration to derive the dynamics of the
projectile \citet{yandf}, these are
\begin{subequations} \label{suvat}
\begin{align}
v &= v_0 + at \label{v} \\
x &= v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \label{xsuvat} \\
v^2 &= v_0^2 + 2ax \\
x &= \left(\frac{v_0 + v}{2}\right) t .
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Where $v$ is the speed at a time $t$, $x$ is the distance from the origin of the coordinate system,
$a$ is the acceleration and $v_0$ is the initial speed.

We will write the equations in component form along the axes. Let $\vv_0$ be the initial velocity.
In component form these will be
\[
v_{0x} = v_0 \cos \alpha
\]
along the $x$-axis and
\[
v_{0y} = v_0 \sin \alpha
\]
where $v_0 = |\vv_0|$ and $\alpha$ is the angle $\vv_0$ makes with the $x$-axis. Now using \eqref{grav}
and \eqref{v} we may find
\begin{subequations} \label{proj-v}
\begin{align}
v_x &= v_0 \cos \alpha \\
\shortintertext{and}
v_y &= v_0 \sin \alpha - gt . \label{proj-vy}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Now, using \eqref{xsuvat} (or by integrating \eqref{proj-v} with respect to $t$), we can obtain the 
standard formulas for the $x$ and $y$ positions during the flight of the projectile:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
x &= (v_0 \cos \alpha) t \label{proj-x} \\
\shortintertext{and}
y &= (v_0 \sin \alpha) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \label{proj-y} .
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Eliminating $t$ between these equations demonstrates that projectiles follow parabolic
paths, giving
\begin{equation}
y = x \tan \alpha - \frac{g}{2v_0^2 \cos^2 \alpha} x^2
\end{equation}
for the path of the projectile.

Finally we may use these equations to find the maximum height, range and time of flight for a
projectile. The maximum height is obtained when $v_y = 0$ and solving \eqref{proj-vy} with this
condition gives
\begin{equation} \label{proj-height}
t_{H} = \frac{v_0 \sin \alpha}{g} .
\end{equation}
The range is obtained by solving for $y=0$ in \eqref{proj-y} and selecting the non trivial root for $t$
of
\begin{equation}
t_{F} = \frac{2 v_0 \sin \alpha}{g}
\end{equation}
where $t_{F}$ is the time of flight for the projectile. Inserting this into \eqref{proj-x} gives
\[
x = \frac{2 v_0^2 \cos \alpha \sin \alpha}{g}
\]
and recalling that $\sin 2 \alpha = 2 \cos \alpha \sin \alpha$ gives
\begin{equation}
x = \frac{v_0^2 \sin 2 \alpha}{g}
\end{equation}
for the range of the projectile.
\subsection{3D Projectile Motion}

Projectile motion in 3 dimensions works in exactly the same fashion as 2D projectile motion. Here we
will take the $z$-axis to be the vertical and $x$ and $y$ axes to be labelling the surface. The only
component of acceleration is along the $z$-axis, with
\[
a_z = -g
\]
as before. All other equations remain the same.

\section{Basic Aerodynamics}

Of course, the flight of a golf ball is inevitably affected by aerodynamics 
\begin{equation}
\rho \matdef{\vec{q}} = - \nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \vec{q} + f
\end{equation}
