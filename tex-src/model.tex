\section{A Model for Golf Ball Flight}

Describe the model, provide diagrams, show basic runs.

Model is a good comprimise between simplicity and flexibility. Can plug in new drag coefficents.
Some parts of the model are purely heurestic like the form for the lift, others seem just plain wrong.
The overall structure is good though. Compare basic run to data, show similar shape but incorrect
carry.

\section{Limitations of the Model}

Talk about the \citet{Jensen2014Comment} comment, dimensional analysis, lead into talking about why
we need to improve this model to find a better form for $c_{D}$. Ppotentially a way to estimate the 
spin ratio. Mention how \citet{Robinson2014Reply} addresses some of the concerns of the comment but does
not give forms for $c_{D}$. Talk about how the golf ball is in the middle between the high and low
reynold limits and this will require some matching modelling to find a good form.
