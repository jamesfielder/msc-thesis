\beforeabstract

Write your abstract here: Remember, it must fit on this A4 page and should
describe contents of the thesis/dissertation. Here might also be a good place
to indicate what you have achieved in the thesis/dissertation and, in the
case of a PhD, what new results you have discovered. Note that for a PhD
single-spacing is used throughout the Abstract, including displayed equations
\[
e = mc^{2}
\]
as for the above example.
