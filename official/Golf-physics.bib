@article{Naruo2014,
abstract = {Aerodynamic forces act on a golf ball during flight. For that purpose in order to develop a golf ball with high performance, it is important to analyze aerodynamic characteristics of the golf ball. On the other hand, dimple pattern of a golf ball is complicate and the influence of dimples hasn’t been investigated in detail. Therefore the influence of golf ball dimples on aerodynamic characteristics was investigated using a wind tunnel and rotating device. Some golf balls whose dimples have different depths were measured. As a result, it was found that the shallower the dimple was, the larger the lift coefficient was. However, when the depth of the dimples was much shallower, the lift coefficient was extremely-little on the slow velocity, i.e. under 30m/s. When the golf ball trajectory which was launched with a driver was calculated under various initial conditions, the ball velocity became under 30 m/s over the vertex of the trajectory in many cases, including professional male golfers and female golfers. Therefore, if the lift coefficient of the velocity of 30m/s becomes smaller, distances will become shorter. Dimple patterns that had a high lift coefficient at all velocities was researched. As a result, it was found that a golf ball with a dimple pattern that has extremely small dimples between large shallow dimples has a high lift coefficient at all velocities, including under 30m/s. In order to investigate the cause of the results, a flow visualization experiment was conducted. Visualization of flow around a golf ball was conducted by generating smoke. Moreover pictures of flow were taken by high-speed video and analyzed by PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry). As a result, there was the difference in the streamline distribution between golf balls.},

abstract = {We make time resolved velocity measurements of steel spheres in free fall through liquid using a continuous ultrasound technique. We explore two different ways to induce large changes in drag on the spheres: 1) a small quantity of viscoelastic polymer added to water and 2) altering the surface of the sphere. Low concentration polymer solutions and/or a pattern of grooves in the sphere surface induce an early drag crisis, which may reduce drag by more than 50 percent compared to smooth spheres in pure water. On the other hand, random surface roughness and/or high concentration polymer solutions reduce drag progressively and suppress the drag crisis. We also present a qualititative argument which ties the drag reduction observed in low concentration polymer solutions to the Weissenberg number and normal stress difference.},

abstract = {A simple, collapsible design for a large water balloon slingshot launcher features a fully adjustable initial velocity vector and a balanced launch platform. The design facilitates quantitative explorations of the dependence of the balloon range and time of flight on the initial speed, launch angle, and projectile mass, in an environment where quadratic air drag is important. Presented are theory and experiments that characterize this drag, and theory and experiments that characterize the nonlinear elastic energy and hysteresis of the latex tubing used in the slingshot. The experiments can be carried out with inexpensive and readily available tools and materials. The launcher provides an engaging way to teach projectile motion and elastic energy to students of a wide variety of ages.},

abstract = {A review of aerodynamics research connected to sport projectiles is presented here. The review’s focus is on work conducted in the current millennium, though deference is made to some classic work still invaluable to modern research. Besides serving as a resource for sea- soned scientists and engineers, this article is especially geared toward young investigators who are just beginning careers in sport science. Basic and sophisticated methods are discussed, including vacuum physics, air drag, lift, numerical approaches, trajectory analysis, wind tunnels, and computational fluid dynamics. Eighteen sports are discussed with an eye to future research.},
