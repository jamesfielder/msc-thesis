abstract ={Steady laminar flows past simple objects, such as a cylinder or a sphere, have been studied for well over a century. Theoretical, experimental and numerical methods have all contributed fundamentally towards our understanding of the resulting flows. This article focuses on developments during the past few decades, when mostly numerical and asymptotical advances have provided insights also for steady, although unstable, high-Reynolds-numbers flow regimes.},
