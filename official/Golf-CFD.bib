@article{Rodriguez2013,
abstract = {It is well known that the flow past a circular cylinder at critical Reynolds number combines flow separation, turbulence transition, reattachment of the flow and further turbulent separation of the boundary layer. In the critical regime, the transition to turbulence in the boundary layer causes the delaying of the separation point and, an important reduction of the drag force on the cylinder surface known as the Drag Crisis. In this paper advanced turbulence simulations at Reynolds numbers in the range of 1.4 × 10 5-8.5 × 105 will be carried out by means of large-eddy simulations. Numerical simulations using unstructured grids up to 70 million of control volumes have been performed on Marenostrum Supercomputer. One of the major outcomes is shedding some light on the shear layer instabilities mechanisms and their role on the drag crisis phenomena. © 2013 The Authors.},

@article{Hoffman2006,
abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;In recent years adaptive stabilized finite element methods, here referred to as General Galerkin (G2) methods, have been developed as a general methodology for the computation of mean value output in turbulent flow. In earlier work, in the setting of bluff body flow, the use of no slip boundary conditions has been shown to accurately capture the separation from a laminar boundary layer, in a number of benchmark problems. In this paper we extend the G2 method to problems with turbulent boundary layers, by including a simple wall-model in the form of a friction boundary condition, to account for the skin friction of the unresolved turbulent boundary layer. In particular, we use G2 to simulate drag crisis for a circular cylinder, by adjusting the friction parameter to match experimental results. By letting the Reynolds number go to infinity and the skin friction go to zero, we get a G2 method for the Euler equations with slip boundary conditions, which we here refer to as an EG2 method. The only parameter in the EG2 method is the discretization parameter, and we present computational results indicating that EG2 may be used to model very high Reynolds numbers flow, such as geophysical flow.},

@article{Saghafian2003,
abstract = {Steady incident flow past a circular cylinder for sub- to supercritical Reynolds number has been simulated as an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equation problem using nonlinear eddy-viscosity modelling assuming two-dimensional flow. The model of Craft et al. (Int. J. Heat Fluid Flow 17 (1996) 108), with adjustment of the coefficients of the 'cubic' terms, predicts the drag crisis at a Reynolds number of about 2 ?? 105 due to the onset of turbulence upstream of separation and associated changes in Strouhal number and separation positions. Slightly above this value, at critical Reynolds numbers, drag is overestimated because attached separation bubbles are not simulated. These do not occur at supercritical Reynolds numbers and drag coefficient, Strouhal number and separation positions are in approximate agreement with experimental measurements (which show considerable scatter). Fluctuating lift predictions are similar to sectional values measured experimentally for subcritical Reynolds numbers but corresponding measurements have not been made at supercritical Reynolds numbers. For oscillatory ambient flow, in-line forces, as defined by drag and inertia coefficients, have been compared with the experimental values of Sarpkaya (J. Fluid Mech. 165 (1986) 61) for values of the frequency parameter, ?? = D2/vT, equal to 1035 and 11240 and Keulegan-Carpenter numbers, KC = U0T/D, between 0.2 and 15 (D is cylinder diameter, v is kinematic viscosity, T is oscillation period, and U0 is the amplitude of oscillating velocity). Variations with KC are qualitatively reproduced and magnitudes show best agreement when there is separation with a large-scale wake, for which the turbulence model is intended. Lift coefficients, frequency and transverse vortex shedding patterns for ?? = 1035 are consistent with available experimental information for ?? ??? 250 - 500. For ?? = 11240, it is predicted that separation is delayed due to more prominent turbulence effects, reducing drag and lift coefficients and causing the wake to be more in line with the flow direction than transverse to it. While these oscillatory flows are highly complex, attached separation bubbles are unlikely and the flows probably two dimensional. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
